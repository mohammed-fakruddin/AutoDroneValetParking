# AutoDroneValetParking
## DGMD E-17 (26008) - Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, Drones, and Artificial Intelligence

#### Team Members

* Ayush Bhasin
* Fakruddin Mohammed
* Mohammed Rahman

### Current Issues

* Parking Grid Technology (a student start-up company which went burst) adopted IOT sensor approached to find the open parking space, publish it to smart mobile app to guide the people looking for parking space.
* Installation of IOT sensor in each parking space needs huge initial capital, complex operation and overhead of maintaining the IOT sensors.



### Motivation

* Therefore, the motivation for this project is to leverage the technology to find cost effective solution and COVID compliant safe parking.



### Project Objectives

**Using technology improve the user experience of parking at busier places addressing the following issues:**

* Bring savings by replacing valet parking with drone assisted parking
* COVID Free parking
* Cost effective phased implementation approach

### Issues & Challenges
* Parking Bays image segmentation using Open CV is sensitive to lighting conditions
* Outdoor testing using Tello drone which weights approximately 80g is challenging due to heavy winds. Therefore, outdoor testing is avoided and resorted back to indoor and hence re-do the obstruction avoidance avoiding indoor objects



### Conclusions
* Overall end-to-end concept of phased implementation for COVID Free Drone Auto Valet Parking is implemented
* Working prototype using Tello drone, toy card and other house hold objects is successfully built



### Future Work

* Test the model outdoor in real parking space
* Collect more outdoor obstruction images and improve the model efficiency
* Optimise the computational pipeline for obstruction avoidance and path planning
